# Bunnylol

My interpretation of the bunnylol tool used at Meta and other tech companies.

## Features
* Saves sites to YAML config file
* Simple web UI to add and remove sites
* Accepts placeholder ("{}") in URLs. It will be replaced by your query minus the first word.

## Disclaimer
This is backed by a YAML file, any real usage other than personal would probably cause issues and wouldn't be very fast at all.
It should probably use a DB, but this is enough for my usecase for now.
